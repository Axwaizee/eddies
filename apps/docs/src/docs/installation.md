## Why Eddies?

The reason to use Eddies is very easy implementation. For those who don't want to build the whole editor from scratch, Eddies allows you to use editor with one line of code. Eddies has support for different types of markup (bold, italic, underline, etc.), also has visual components that make writing easier (bubble menu, text counter, etc.) and extensions (syntax highlighting, emojis). You can style the editor very easily with css variables or classes.
